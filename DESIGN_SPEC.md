# CHADDYTWICEOVER — Hobbyist Portfolio Design Spec (v2)

## 1) Design Goal

Create a personal site that feels authentic, visually distinct, and easy to explore, while documenting growth as a web dev student.

Visitors should quickly understand:

1. What you’re currently learning
2. What you’re experimenting with
3. How your style/skills are evolving
4. How to connect with you

---

## 2) Positioning

### Primary identity (default theme)

- Clean and modern
- Focused on readability and structure
- Feels like a personal lab notebook + portfolio

### Secondary identity (Y2K mode)

- Nostalgic, playful, and intentionally different
- Keeps the same content and navigation structure
- Acts as personality expression, not a separate product

**Rule:** Both themes must present the same information architecture.

---

## 3) Content Architecture (Top to Bottom)

## Hero

- Short label describing the craft area
- Honest headline about building/learning
- 1 short paragraph on current focus
- 2 simple actions:
  - See experiments
  - Say hi

## About

- Explain current stage (student / learning in public)
- Mention what skills are being practiced
- Keep tone humble and clear

## Work

- 2–4 live experiments/projects
- Each card should include:
  - Project name
  - What it explores
  - Skill focus
  - Tech used
  - Status (active, iterating, archived)

## Contact

- One low-friction path (email)
- Invitation to share feedback, ideas, or resources

---

## 4) Voice & Copy Guidelines

Use language that is:

- Honest (no inflated business claims)
- Curious (learning-forward)
- Personal (first person is okay)
- Specific (what the project actually teaches you)

Avoid language that sounds like:

- Agency sales copy
- Guaranteed outcomes
- Fabricated metrics

---

## 5) Visual System

## Type scale

- Keep current hierarchy (H1/H2/body) with strong readability
- Body text should remain comfortable for long scanning

## Spacing rhythm

- Base rhythm: 8px
- Give sections enough air to feel intentional
- Preserve denser, boxier rhythm in Y2K mode

## Width and legibility

- Content max width around current implementation
- Keep paragraph measure in readable range

## Motion

- Motion supports orientation only
- Reduced motion respected globally
- Minimal/no decorative motion in Y2K mode

---

## 6) Component Guidelines

## Navigation

- Clear anchors: About / Work / Contact
- Theme switch should stay visible but not dominate

## Buttons

- Primary and secondary styles are enough
- Action labels should match hobbyist intent (e.g., See Experiments, Say Hi)

## Project Cards

- Prioritize what was learned and explored
- Keep visuals supportive, not overpowering

## Footer

- Keep minimal: copyright + identity

---

## 7) UX Rules

1. Every section should be understandable in under 5 seconds.
2. Personal authenticity beats polished marketing language.
3. Preserve the same structure across both themes.
4. Accessibility remains required (focus states, contrast, keyboard, reduced motion).
5. Add complexity only when it helps understanding.

---

## 8) Instrumentation Policy

Default approach: **no analytics required** for now.

If analytics are added later, keep them lightweight and privacy-conscious:

- Track only high-level interactions
- Avoid personal data collection
- Keep transparency in README

---

## 9) Ongoing Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Keep it honest

- Ensure copy reflects current skill level
- Remove any over-claiming language

### Phase 2: Show progress

- Add/update experiments regularly
- Note what changed in each project over time

### Phase 3: Improve craft

- Refine spacing, hierarchy, and clarity
- Keep accessibility quality high as the site grows

---

## 10) Success Criteria

The site succeeds if it:

- Feels true to where you are now
- Makes experiments easy to browse
- Shows visible growth over time
- Encourages friendly feedback and connections

---

## 11) Non-Goals

- Selling services aggressively
- Pretending to be a full agency/product studio
- Heavy growth funnels or complex lead capture
- Overengineering before fundamentals are strong

Keep this version focused: **learning, experimentation, personality, and steady progress.**
